			My 3 Favorite Games:
		</h2>
		<ul> 
			<li> Animal Crossing: New Leaf, because it's beautifully simple and just really fun to talk about. As well as the music, something about it is so captivating!</li>
			<li> Call of Duty: Black Ops, I played this a lot when I was younger and though I've never been good at it, it's just been a classic and my go-to if I am bored.</li>
			<li> Viva Pinata, this was my absolute favorite game when I was younger, it's just so nostalgic and I want to see if it's still as fun as it was to me before.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>
			3 Things I'd Like to Learn
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Honestly any basic skills would be nice and cool to know as I am very new to this</li>
			<li>Being able to code some more visuals and incorporate colors and details, which again is very simple but sounds exciting!!!!</li>
			<li>And lastly, coding interactive programs and knowing how to do more than lists lol, as that is currently all I can do</li>
		</ul>
